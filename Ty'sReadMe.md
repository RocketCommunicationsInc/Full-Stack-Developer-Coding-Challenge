Backend:
I used production level authentication which requires the user to verify their identity with email verification. I also implemented password reset in case the user forgets their password.

Client: I used React/Redux and used useEffect to fetch the data from the database (I used Postgresql). I also added another component (Chart Pane) that makes the UX really nice.
