## TODOS
* I don't like how the column width changes when you click sort on a column. The caret icon changes the width and it feels janky.

### Caret Icon
* The caret icon used in the Tree component is also used in the Table component to indicate the sort state of a column. 
  This icon doesn't appear to be included in the icon sprite svg. You may want to consider adding it to the 
  icon svg. The [documentation](https://astrouxds.com/components/icons-and-symbols) has Caret as an item under Component Icons.
